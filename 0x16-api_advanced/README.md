# API advanced

Questions involving APIs are common for interviews. Sometimes they’re as simple as ‘write a Python script that queries a given endpoint’, sometimes they require you to use recursive functions and format/sort the results.

A great API to use for some practice is the Reddit API. There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented.
